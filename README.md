![Project Logo](/images/logo.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the E-commerce Goods Rental Platform â€“ a solution for renting a wide range of items, from furniture to two-wheelers, and more. This repository houses the backend components of our platform.

### Features

- **Database Models:** I have meticulously designed database models for orders/rentals, products, categories, and users to ensure efficient data management.

- **Authentication:** The platform provides a robust authentication system, including user registration and login. Forgot Password and Reset Password features have been seamlessly integrated for added user convenience.

- **Image Upload:** I leveraged AWS S3 bucket services for seamless image uploading. This ensures that product images are presented to users in the most visually appealing way possible.

- **Payment Gateway:** I've integrated Razorpay as our payment gateway, making the checkout process smooth and secure for product orders/rentals.

### Avoiding Conflicts (Syncing your fork)

To avoid conflicts, you can add an 'upstream' for your git repository, as other pull requests may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

To add an upstream remote, use the following command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2023`

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing: `git remote -v`

To pull any new changes from the parent repository, run: `git merge upstream/master`. This will allow you to easily solve any conflicts in your repository. It's a good idea to use this command frequently in between your own commits to ensure your repository is up to date with its parent.
